# TurkeyCityDistrictCoordinates
A JSON file containing information about the cities and their districts in Turkey, including coordinates and various details.

* The JSON file named `il-ilce-coordinates.json` in the `cities_with_coordinates` folder contains the coordinates of cities and districts along with some information about them. 
* I have created a Python script to add the coordinates of these provinces and districts to the JSON file, which can be found in the `add_coordinates_il_ilce_tr.py` file.
* All data has been obtained using the OpenStreetMap API

#### Important Note: The data may not be entirely accurate. Please use it with caution and be aware of this.
